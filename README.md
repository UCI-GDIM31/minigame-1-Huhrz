## Devlog
A video game is like a theater play. The Scene is the stage where everything happens. The GameObjects are the actors on the stage, like characters, props, or lights. The Components are the costumes, skills, and scripts. Without the stage, the story has no place; without the actors, the stage is empty; and without the components, the actors canâ€™t do anything. Together, they make the game come alive.
